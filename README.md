# CS306-Database-Systems

Our database will organize data for an online game. 
Users will login by their username(unique) and password. The user will also have e-mail, birthday, hours played, 
profile picture, team tag and level as personal information. The users can have many characters but characters have 
only one user. Each character can have a character name(unique), health, mana, armour, strength, agility, intelligence, 
inventory, level, gender, gold. Characters must have only one race and only one class at once. The characters can have 
different options for races and classes. Races are divided into 5 subgroups such as elf, orc, human, werewolf and panda.
Classes are divided into 3 subgroups such as archer, knight, shaman. Many characters can be in one region. Every region 
has a name(unique), foliage, players in and climate features. Each player has a unique inventory. In this inventory, they 
can store items such as weapons, scrolls, potions and armour etc.
